It's deprecated! [SYZOJ2](https://github.com/syzoj/syzoj) is also a choice for you.

SYZOJ2 is maintained by [@Menci](https://github.com/Menci) now. Menci is a nice and skilled developer, I believe he will make SYZOJ better. SYZOJ2 is written in node.js, it has good organization and clean code.

Thanks for Fmuckss and who has made the contributions to SYZOJ.
